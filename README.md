# Augmented Reality Museum App

## Introduction
We propose to create an augmented reality (AR) app that simulates a small USF museum experience. This app will enhance visitor engagement with interactive features like QR code scanning, audio integration, and 3D models. Our goal is to combine technology and art to make cultural experiences more accessible and enjoyable at USF.

## Project Description

### Virtual Museum Experience
The app will recreate a small museum featuring a mix of paintings and 3D objects.

### Main Menu
- Provides general information about the museum.
- Includes an "Immersive Experience" button for interactive exploration.

### QR Code Interaction
- QR codes will be placed next to each art piece.
- Visitors can scan the QR code to view:
  - Information about the artwork.
  - Details about the artist and the genre.

### Audio Integration
- The app will play sounds or music related to the artwork.
  - For example, the app could play music from a famous artist when scanning a specific piece.

### 3D Representation
- Some artwork will have a 3D model viewable in augmented reality.
- This feature enhances interactivity and engagement for a more immersive experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity**: The core engine for the app and augmented reality functionality.
- **Vuforia**: For augmented reality features, including image and object tracking.
- **QR Code Scanning**: To trigger interactive experiences for each artwork.
- **Audio Integration**: For immersive soundscapes related to the exhibits.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/augmented-reality-museum-app.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Ensure you have **Vuforia** in Unity.
4. Build and deploy the app to your target device (ex: iOS or Android).
